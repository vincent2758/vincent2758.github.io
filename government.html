      <h2>Leadership and Administration</h2>
      <p>
        Dunkirk Taritor operates under a <strong>Ministerial Monarchy</strong>, where the House of Commons suggest, The house of the Lords, approve.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><b>Monarch:</b> His Majesty the King Voncelotusk</li>
        <li><b>Premier:</b> Appointed by the Monarch</li>
        <li><b>Legislature:</b> People's Council and Monarch</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>How the process works in the Parliament.</h2>
      <p>
        Firstly, the citizens are required to suggest their thoughts and proceed it through an established channel, which is <i>The House of Commons</i>.
        And only then, the House of Common would call upon a parliamentary conference call within themselves.
        After hours of a thoroughly discussion, The House of Commons would be assembled into two groups/parties, that is:
        <ul>        
        <li>Westyrus (Republics in general)</li>
        <li>The Neutralises (Only after a member/members of both parties voted for being neutral)</li>
        <li>Dungkerk (Democrats in general)</li></ul>
        Only after the bill has enough votes by both parties, it would be passed to the Senator of the house to continue to check into the bill thoroughly and are supervised by one of the Royal Agent.
        Now, after the Senator has done with bill, The House of the Lords would summon The House of Commons with 
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_Rod" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"> Black Rod</a> 
        knocking on the door of the House of Commons.
        The House of Commons will be escorted by the Black Rod to the House of the Lords, then present the bill, <i>awaiting for His/Her majesty the King/Queen to sign the bill for approval.</i>
        <b><i>The End.</i></b>
